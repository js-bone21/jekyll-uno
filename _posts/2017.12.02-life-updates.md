Alright, I'm about to lay down some life updates on y'all, so this will be a relaxed post.

### Leaving Shanghai

Welp, being Shanghaied has come to an end. Yes, I'm no longer living in Shanghai. To everyone who had dreamed of visiting...you missed your chance! You should've come earlier and we could've done many touristy things in SH, but alas, you didn't and now we cannot.

### More Travel, Less Problems [sic]

So, Julie and I set off yesterday actually for a bit of travel in China and then in SE Asia. If anyone is planning to be around, please give me a shout! Come visit me now!!! And SE Asia high

Safe travels and happy surfing!
