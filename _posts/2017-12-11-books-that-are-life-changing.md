These 5 books that have made a significant impact on my professional career and also on the way I pursue issues in my personal life.

###The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business - Charles Duhigg

###New Seeds of Contemplation - Thomas Merton

###The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen Covey

###The Wisdom of Insecurity - Alan Watts

It took roughly 6 months to decompress from all the stress and unhealthy habits that I'd formed while working in a toxic corporate environment. It wasn't really until July that I started considering what I wanted to work on going forward and it wasn't until August that I started to become frustrated with myself for not being able to simply *decide* what it is I wanted to do.

This newfound stress all came crashing into me as I ventured out to Mongolia to renew my Chinese visa and take in the scenery of the least-densely populated country on this planet.

I started to read "The Wisdom of Insecurity" as I ventured through The Land of the Eternal Blue Sky. This happened to be a perfect backdrop for getting through Watts' dense and seemingly circuitous philosophy. I've practiced several forms of meditation through my adult life and through Watts' suggestions, slowly started the process to let my self fade away and simply experience. I began to listen to my body and the world as it is, rather than how I chose to interpret it.

> “There are, then, two ways of understanding an experience. The first is to compare it with the memories of other experiences, and so to name and define it. This is to interpret it in accordance with the dead and the past. The second is to be aware of it as it is, as when, in the intensity of joy, we forget past and future, let the present be all, and thus do not even stop to think, “I am happy.”  
-Alan Watts, The Wisdom of Insecurity

The Wisdom of Insecurity is not an island in my journey - there are [many other books that helped shape my life in 2017][ComingSoon] - but it was at this time that I came to better understand the peacefulness of the present...something I had already written in my Personal Mission Statement (line 2), but that I need to constantly remind myself of every single day.

> “Tomorrow and plans for tomorrow can have no significance at all unless you are in full contact with the reality of the present, since it is in the present and only in the present that you live. There is no other reality than present reality, so that, even if one were to live for endless ages, to live for the future would be to miss the point everlastingly.”  
-Alan Watts, The Wisdom of Insecurity

Alright, enough with the quotes. Please go [read the book][WisdomofInsecurity]! It's really very wonderful and so much so that I've already read it a second time since then.


###Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less - Greg McKeown
Instead of getting a million things done in all directions and accomplishing little, what if you focused all of your energy to get one thing done? That is the premise of Greg McKeown’s book and something that I needed to hear at exactly this point in my life (although it probably wouldn’t have hurt me to read it earlier!)

My interests have always been varying - from middle and high school when I played nearly every sport, to the last year in which I’ve made some progress learning about 7 coding languages.

###Will it Fly? - Pat Flynn

Will it Fly? is a book aimed at anyone who has an idea for a business or product that they’d like to pursue. I had initially purchased the book on a whim (it was part of a GoodReads sale) and also started it on a whim (I was just looking through the books on my Kindle for something new to start), but it quickly became life-changing for me.

In the first two chapters, [the author] starts not by doing any of the fun things one usually associates with a new business - brainstorming excellent names - but rather, starts by asking the reader to identify what it is that makes them tick. After all, as [author] points out in the first few chapters, the most significant factor of how well your business does and whether or not you enjoy the fruits of your labor is if it’s meaningful and important to you. So first thing is first - spend your time determining if the idea is right for you, for your values, and for your interests. Only then, can you dive further.

Through the thought experiments and visualization techniques in book (coupled with those in the aforementioned books, I began writing down the things I’m most interested in and where I see myself going.
