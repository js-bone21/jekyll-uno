Alright, I'm about to lay down some life updates on y'all, so this will be a relaxed post.

### Leaving Shanghai

Welp, being Shanghaied has come to an end. Yes, I'm no longer living in Shanghai. To everyone who had dreamed of visiting...you missed your chance! You should've come earlier and we could've done many touristy things in SH, but alas, you didn't and now we cannot.

Julie has decided to leave Disney English, and to anyone thinking of working with them, our collective recommendation **is to not to** [sic]. I don't want to bash too hard, so I won't.

I will say that neither Julie nor I ever want to work for a profit-motivated entity ever again. When the sole purpose of a business is to make money, it **will** fail in the long run - look for another post on this...it's on my list. This is not to say that businesses shouldn't turn a profit - this is kind of the point of for-profit businesses entities, no? - but the point of business is to add value to/for your customers. A customer-centric business is the only sustainable business.

I'll say it again...

> A customer-centric business is the only sustainable business.

### More Travel, Less Problems [sic]

Alright, so I got a little heavy but on to better/nicer things.

So, Julie and I set off just the other day actually for a bit of travel in China and then in SE Asia. If anyone is planning to be around, please give me a shout! **Come visit me now!!!**

We're just finishing up Huangshan (aka Yellow Mountain), and let me tell you guys...it is spectacular!!! It's already on my list to come back. The mountains themselves as well as the unique atmosphere that surrounds it means that you're constantly surprised each minute. In my experience, you're in a thick fog one second (actually, a cloud...yes, a _**real**_ cloud, like in the sky) and then it blows away and you're left with a stunning view of a sheer rock face sparsely covered with trees that bear the name of the scenic area itself - [Pinus hwangshanensis][1].

Welp, what's next on the list, you ask? Here's the rough rundown:

Western China - til Dec 17
North Vietnam - Christmas (and maybe NYE)
Cambodia - Likely early Jan
Thailand - mid-late Jan to early-mid Feb

And then...well, that's up in the air right now...and perhaps the biggest issue determining where I'll go next is jobs.

SOOO! And here's my shameless plug to you all, if anyone has contacts in the motorcycle industry (especially manufacturers in motorcycle racing), PLEASE PLESAE PLEASE get in touch with me ([FB](http://fb.me/{{ site.author.facebook_username }}) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter_username }})). #notdesperate

### Not Super Travel Blog

I haven't really wanted this to be a travel blog because I think there are so many excellent sources of travel information already out there (even that I use - links below). That said, if there's enough of you guys demanding I write more things about how/what/where, I'm not opposed to dedicating a section of this blog to that...you'll just have to let me know in the comments (well, on [FB](http://fb.me/{{ site.author.facebook_username }}) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter_username }})).

I've written a few things for indivudlas of you before, and I maintain the things I've written mostly in google docs, but they're usually sporadic, train of thought FaceBook messages for the most part. Not as cohesive as thought-out or constructed articles or webpages, like most of the ones below.


Safe travels and happy surfing!
