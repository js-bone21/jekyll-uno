For as long as I can remember, I’ve had an obsession with two wheels. Although my level of immediate interest in this wonderful class of vehicles has ebbed through my nearly 27 years of life, I feel it’s served as a focal point, and an interest I intend to pursue unceasingly moving forward...let me explain.

### Dec 2016: Let (F)Unemployment Begin!
As a twenty-sixth birthday present to myself, I [left my job for better-managed opportunities][1].

This has been the best thing I've done since I decided to study abroad in Istanbul roughly 6 years ago now. Not surprisingly, many people ask when I'm getting a new job or what I do for work, and I've never really had a good answer other than "I'll find one if/when I need one" or "I'm not worried about it".

I suppose it's a bit confusing why even I would bring this up in regards to motorcycles, but, to me, it's quite clear - (F)Unemployment has given me the opportunity to seek out what it is that I want to do and to focus exclusively on how to get there.

If you haven't read it by now, I highly recommend reading ["The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"][2]. One of the biggest actions that came from reading this book is writing a [Personal Mission Statement][#] for myself. Here's what I wrote in January 2017:

##### Fix This
> I will prioritize my personal relationships.  
I will focus on today.  
I will never compromise my personal or professional integrity.  
I succeed when others succeed.  
I will listen twice as much as I speak.  
I will give more than I take.  
I am a student.  
I don’t make mistakes. I learn lessons.

This was the action that set me upon the path of deciding only to do what is best for me; to prioritize these items above all else. This is not a static statement, however, and I'm currently working to revamp this statement for 2018 [Stay Tuned][#].

### Jun 2017: 2xxx Mile US Road trip
One of my favorite events/trips from my time (F)Unemployed was simply riding around parts of the US on my trusty stead, the infamous [KLR650][link to pt 2, section on KLR].

From dirt, boring open highway, mud, twisties, flat, mountainous, backroads, city skylines, and small-town America, I pretty much did everything the US had to offer (except sand and desert...so, I have some more work to do!).

Some people think I don't love the US because I'm constantly (really, constantly) criticizing it. Or traveling somewhere else. ___This could not be further from the truth.___

I absolutely love the US, and I criticize it because I think we can make it greater than Donald Trump every dreamed of. I travel other places to see what else there is, to see how other people live, interact, and think, and because I feel that I'll always have an opportunity to live and travel here in my home country.

> I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my list.

That said, road trips are fun, but road trips on motorcycle are absolutely the best way to see this wonderfully beautiful country of ours. I cannot be convinced otherwise. If anyone reading this wants to take a road trip of any kind, do not hesitate for a single second to call me (it's absolutely urgent, so don't text!).

### August 2017: The Revelation
Eventually, I'll get around to writing about [the books that changed my life in 2017][#]. But for now, we'll have to get by on my explanation of the impact of two such books - The Wisdom of Insecurity, by Alan Watts and Essentialism, by Greg McKeown.

I read this book as I ventured through the least-densely populated country on this green Earth - Mongolia aka The Land of the Eternal Blue Sky. This happened to be a perfect backdrop for getting through Watts' dense and seemingly circuitous philosophy.

Although I've practiced different forms of meditation throughout my life, I felt slightly different in my meditation sessions interspersed through my readings of this book. I felt more aware of everything around me, or as Watts constantly remarks, "that is". I began to explore the line that most humans have made for as long as I've understood between "me, myself" and what ***IS***.

Perhaps the best way to explain it is as Watts explains what it means to understand an experience - and that is to not understand it, but to experience it:

> “There are, then, two ways of understanding an experience. The first is to compare it with the memories of other experiences, and so to name and define it. This is to interpret it in accordance with the dead and the past. The second is to be aware of it as it is, as when, in the intensity of joy, we forget past and future, let the present be all, and thus do not even stop to think, “I am happy.”

Of course, there are many quotes

> “Tomorrow and plans for tomorrow can have no significance at all unless you are in full contact with the reality of the present, since it is in the present and only in the present that you live. There is no other reality than present reality, so that, even if one were to live for endless ages, to live for the future would be to miss the point everlastingly.”



Motorcycles. There’s just no feeling in the world, in my opinion, like being on two wheels in the open air. Although I similarly love bicycles, as two wheelers, motorcycles have a enhanced emotional connection to me. I cannot count the times I’ve ridden my motorcycle out of a neighborhood in the morning and just suddenly felt a wave of positive energy flow over me - the crisp morning air blowing through my jacket, ...blah..feel this out.


As I soaked in the Mongolian sun overlooking endless landscapes in different parts of the country, I found myself taking fewer and fewer pictures as I focused on my self-awareness.

I'm not sure if I chose the book based on its title or if it was pure coincidence that my reading of the book and my travels to Mongolia coincided.

Priority. When this word first came into use in [please go back and reference this exactly as it is referenced in Essentialism - so I actually read this book just after getting back from Mongolia], it was singular. It wasn’t until the late 20th century that individuals, especially managers, began to pervert the word by making it plural.

A priority is simply the single most important thing.

Before I came across this revelation...that priority is inherently singular, I had already begun drawing closer to motorcycles as a career.

This feeling initially set in during the quiet, serenity, and gorgeous landscapes I experienced in the least densely populated country on Earth, the Land of the Eternal Blue Sky - Mongolia.

It was further cemented after reading Essentialism and feeling that all humans seek this one priority in work as well as their personal life. This is, after all, why I wrote a personal mission statement, and why relationships are first.

Rejuvenation, Reflection, and then, Revelation

Safe travels and happy surfing!

[Move this section into the funemployment section?]

By August, it was nearly 8 months since I’d left my corporate position that had taken me through three states and showed me just how terrible, money-centered, and out of touch management can be. My two and a half years in that particular corporate environment has definitely killed my desire to work for any such corporate entity ever again.
~~seek an MBA for fear that I too could become a spreadsheet jockey [write an article about this].~~

However, leaving that position had given me plenty of time to decompress, [refocus my energy], [write a personal mission statement](#), and most importantly, read (and write a bit).

It was during my mission statement writing and through subsequent books and reflection periods that I came across the thing that I will focus my career on.

[eh, that last statement wasn't 100% true...]
