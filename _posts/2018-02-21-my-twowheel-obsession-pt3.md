For as long as I can remember, I’ve had an obsession with two wheels. Although my level of immediate interest in this wonderful class of vehicles has ebbed through my nearly 27 years of life, I feel it’s served as a focal point, and an interest I intend to pursue unceasingly moving forward...let me explain.

### Dec 2016: Let (F)Unemployment Begin!


### Jun 2017: 2xxx Mile US Roadtrip


### August 2017: The Revelation

Priority. When this word first came into use in [please go back and reference this exactly as it is referenced in Essentialism], it was singular. It wasn’t until the late 20th century that individuals, especially managers, began to pervert the word by making it plural.

A priority is simply the single most important thing.

Before I came across this revelation...that priority is inherently singular, I had already begun drawing closer to motorcycles as a career.

By August, it was nearly 8 months since I’d left my corporate position that had taken me through three states and showed me just how terrible, money-centered, and out of touch management can be. My two and a half years in that particular corporate environment has definitely killed my desire to work for any such corporate entity ever again.
~~seek an MBA for fear that I too could become a spreadsheet jockey [write an article about this].~~

However, leaving that position had given me plenty of time to decompress, [refocus my energy], [write a personal mission statement](#), and most importantly, read (and write a bit).

It was during my mission statement writing and through subsequent books and reflection periods that I came across the thing that I will focus my career on. This feeling initially set in during the quiet, serenity, and gorgeous landscapes I experienced in the least densely populated country on Earth, the Land of the Eternal Blue Sky - Mongolia.

Motorcycles. There’s just no feeling in the world, in my opinion, like being on two wheels in the open air. Although I similarly love bicycles, as two wheelers, motorcycles have a enhanced emotional connection to me. I cannot count the times I’ve ridden my motorcycle out of a neighborhood in the morning and just suddenly felt a wave of positive energy flow over me - the crisp morning air blowing through my jacket, ...blah..feel this out.

It was further cemented after reading Essentialism and feeling that all humans seek this one priority in work as well as their personal life. This is, afterall, why I wrote a personal mission statement, and why relationships are first.

Blah blah….not getting where I want


Safe travels and happy surfing!
