With all the buzz in the last few years about autonomous vehicles and especially with all the progress, it seems inevitable that sooner, rather than later, humans will no longer drive themselves to and from. This begs the question about what happens to vehicles that are not autonomous...and more importantly (to me), what happens to vehicles that are much harder to make autonomous - specifically, motorcycles.

### Dude, Where's My (Flying) Car?!
Alright, first, I must admit that I'm a little skeptical of the autonomous future that is blowing up headlines every week. Yes, [Tesla's AutoPilot][Tesla] is pretty freaking cool and there are other examples of (not so attractive) varying levels of self-driving cars...I'm just not completely sold yet.

I don't want to get into too much depth in this post about whether or not this will happen...I just want to point out that I'm skeptical.

### What About Traditional Human-Driven Cars?
Well, of course these won't be going away any time soon. And the transition will be difficult to manage, in my opinion. There's already a lot of difficulty in the self-driving car surrounding what to do with the uncertainty of human drivers. There are even people modelling their self-driving algorithms based on what humans do [reference needed][human-model].

But one major technology, V2X or Vehicle-to-Everything communication will help ease this transition to autonomous cars (should that future come) and we've already made some...impressive but not so [impressive progress to date][GM].

If you're familiar with adaptive cruise control or lane departure warning...then you already know a little bit about the kinds of sensors and algorithms that will ease this transition. The next step is to use that (and much more) data in a group environment.

Just like blinkers were used (or not so often...depending where you live) to give signals to human drivers, V2X will allow vehicles to communicate not just with each other, but with pedestrians, bicyclists, infrastructure, and...my favorite...motorcyclists.

### Towards Zero Motorcycle Fatalities
Ok, so that may be a pipe-dream as long as young males are allowed to purchase machines that have the power-to-weight ratio of a Ferrari but only cost as much as a thoroughly-used sedan. But a boy can dream.

Seriously, one of the most dangerous locations for any driver - motorcycle or car - is an intersection. With a limited size, it's easy for a motorcycle to be hidden from the view of a driver by other vehicles on the road...and it's why one of the things most stressed in courses for motorcycle licensing is to "assume that you're invisible". That is, ride in a way that you assume no one can see you - expect unexpected lane changes, brake early, avoid blindspots at all costs.

Probably one of the biggest nightmares for motorcyclists is the threat of a car turning left in front of you as you try to pass an intersection...but it happens pretty frequently.

What if your car knew that there was an oncoming motorcycle? In the same way it "knows" if there's a kid crossing behind you as you back out of your driveway. The car doesn't necessarily have to visually identify the bike...but with V2X, the motorcycle can broadcast its position, direction, and speed to other vehicles in the area.
