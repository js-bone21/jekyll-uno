Lane-splitting (or lane filtering) is a commonly used motorcycling tactic in many parts of the world. Unfortunately, in the US, it's only legal in one state, California. One of the most liberal states is one of the leaders in freedom of choice for motorcyclists. So what is it, and why should I support it?

### Riding Background Disclaimer
I'm not from California and have never lived there, so I've never given much thought to lane-filtering. That changed when I decided to ride in Asia.

### What is Lane Splitting/Filtering?
Lane Splitting, Lane Filtering...sounds the same, but I recently learned, [are different][1]. What's the difference then?

Lane Splitting is often thought of as giving motorcycles/cyclists the right to ride between two lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. This often gives drivers a bit of pause, especially in the USA where people aren't so used to driving with/around their two-wheeled counterparts.

Lane Filtering on the other hand, is about allowing two-wheeled vehicles the ability to filter through traffic when it's stopped or moving slowly. What does this look like? Well, check out the excellent [video explanation here][2].



### Why do it?
Why would one, motorcyclists or driver, want to filter?

First off,, one of the major benefits is that it helps traffic flow more smoothly. Motorcyclists aren't in traffic taking up an inordinate amount of space (because there's a certain amount of space in front of and behind), but rather, moving to the front of traffic between cars where there is enough space for their small vehicle.


Thirdly, it's [safer for motorcyclists][3]. Yes, you read that correctly! Lane filtering means that motorcyclists are out of the way of traffic and moving forward. This not only increases visibility immediately for the rider, but increases visibility and awareness of all motorcycles.

### Where is it legal?
Only California.

Shame really. One of the most liberal states in the nation is one of the leaders in freedom of choice for motorcyclists.

### How does it benefit me?
Lane Filtering allows two-wheeled vehicles to stay out of the way of their four-wheeled bretheren as much as possible, easing traffic for everyone, increasing visibility, and raising awareness.



Until there's some sort of motorcycle education component in [licensing courses for drivers][4], it is always safer for motorcyclists to ride as if they're invisible. This means placing themselves in the most obvious position on any road and anticipating changes in traffic conditions.




Safe travels and happy surfing!
