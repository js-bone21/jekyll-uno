I've moved a lot in the years since I'm graduated university...and that doesn't include all the times I've moved while I've been in university (check out the Full List below).

Although I've found it quite easy to find links online claiming that moving is "the third most stressful life event" according to "studies", I haven't found a single one of these that actually links to the study/studies.

And there are, of course, articles on [how to deal with the stress of moving] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-carol-morgan/11-tips-to-cope-with-the-stress-of-moving_b_8676914.html).

I often think about the friends I "left behind" in each of these moves and their corresponding life events.

I woke up last week to many messages questioning about the status of family and friends in Texas due to the horrible effects of Hurricane Harvey. The friends who sent these messages to me are located in Turkey, The Netherlands, Tunisia, Russia, and elsewhere. People who would have no other vested interest other than the fact that I'd befriended them at some point in the past. I feel that the very nature of our friendship compelled them to reach out to me, as a loved one, to check in on the status of my own friends and family.

Sure, there's so little effort in sending a message over the internet these days, but how many of us even struggle to wish "Happy Birthday!" to all our many Facebook friends?

To me, social media isn't just a toy, but instead it's a tool. A tool that has kept alive many friendships that may not otherwise remain alive due not only to my various moves over the past few years, but also due to geographic isolation - a _____ that has separated people for the entirety of human history.

To me, social media is a wonderful tool that we use to breakdown the geographic barriers that would otherwise separate us. It also serves (or can serve) to breakdown many of the other barriers that separate us - religion, nationality, etc.

I've not only been able to expand my world-view by traveling to different places and meeting people with different backgrounds, but I've also made them part of my network of friends. I have, as much as they have, a vested interest in their families, in their cultures, in their languages, in their person.

Social media hasn't just allowed me to make friends across the globe, it's allowed me to keep friends across the globe.
