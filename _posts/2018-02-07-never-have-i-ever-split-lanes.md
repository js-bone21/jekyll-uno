### What is Lane Splitting/Filtering?
Lane Splitting, Lane Filtering...sounds the same, but I recently learned, [are pretty different][1]. What's the difference then?

Lane Splitting is often thought of as giving motorcycles/cyclists the right to ride between two lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. This often gives drivers a bit of pause, especially in the USA where people aren't so used to driving with/around their two-wheeled counterparts.

Lane Filtering on the other hand, is about allowing two-wheeled vehicles the ability to filter through traffic when it's stopped or moving slowly. What does this look like? Well, check out the excellent [video explanation here][2].

### Why do it?
Why would one, motorcyclists or driver, want to filter?

Well, one of the major benefits is that it helps traffic flow more smoothly. First off, motorcyclists aren't in traffic taking up an inordinate amount of space, but rather, moving to the front of traffic between cars where there is enough space for their small vehicle.

"But wait, that's cutting!" Secondly, since cars are too big to filter through traffic - it is, after all, why traffic exists, motorcycles can filter through to the front. They often accelerate more quickly than cars (because they are capable of higher acceleration) and therefore will even be out of your way after the light turns green.

Thirdly, it's safer for motorcyclists - who are [not infrequently rearended by cars][3]. Lane filtering means that motorcyclists are out of the way of traffic moving forward. (increasing visibility)

### Where is it legal?


### How does it benefit me?
Lane Filtering allows two-wheeled vehicles to stay out of the way of their four-wheeled bretheren as much as possible, easing traffic, increasing visibility, and...



Safe travels and happy surfing!
