I am a white, middle-class, Christian, heterosexual, American male. The only way I could get more boring is if I leaned Democratic and drove a Prius. Well, ok, I don't have a Prius.

My point is that I'm one of the most privileged people on the face of this green Earth. I literally have it all, and while there are some people who may deny the tailwinds they've enjoyed all their lives, I am not one.

### 'MURICA!

To start, few Americans realize how absolutely great our situation is. And I don't mean in the *blessed* sort of way that I feel many Americans are apt to describe their #win in the birth lottery.

For 21 years, I considered myself lower-middle class. Of course, I realized I had more than a lot of people, but there's something about being relatively poor in private school to put things in perspective and make one humble.

During my second semester in Turkey, after exhausting the tourist attractions, I had the opportunity to see the real Turkey, or rather, the real Istanbul. It was shocking to me to find out that fewer than 50% of the residents of Istanbul have seen the sea ['[Ref Needed]']() - a nearly all-encompassing feature of the city that lies at the crossroads of East and West. What was even more eye-opening was the abject poverty I saw - and I'm sure I wasn't even in the worst neighborhoods.

Although there always seem to be impoverished individuals in any big city, I had thought that the beggars on the big tourist streets were the worst of them - purposefully ragged, head to the ground, hand or cup out in the best humanly-possible attempt to illicit pity and drop any amount of currency.

It becomes more obvious when entire city blocks of people - mostly mothers, children, and elderly in the middle of the day - are nearly as haggard-looking with distended stomachs from hunger. And yet, humanly hopeful and lively.



Safe travels and happy surfing!
