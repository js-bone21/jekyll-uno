> "Moving is one of life's [most stressful events](#afterthoughts)"
> - Unattributed

I've moved a lot in the years since I've graduated university...and that doesn't include all the times I've moved while I've been in university (check out the [Full List](#my-moving-history) below).

I often think about the friends I "left behind" in each of these moves and/or life events. At the same time, I feel like social media is my tool of choice to maintain and even to strengthen many of the friendships I've made over the years.

### Facebook Friends or Real Friends?

I woke up last week to many messages questioning the status of family and friends in Texas due to the terrible effects of Hurricane Harvey. The friends who sent these messages to me are located in Turkey, The Netherlands, Tunisia, Russia, and, of course, Texas itself. These are people that I've met and befriended on the road or who were on the road and probably wouldn't have any vested interest in the events in Texas had our paths never crossed.

> To me, it was quite touching.

These people, of various faiths, nationalities, and cultures felt compelled to reach out to me, as a loved one, to check in on the status of my own friends and family. To me, it was quite touching.

I think everyone feels it and there's just not so much talk about it (that I've seen/read)

Sure, there's so little effort in sending a message over the internet these days, but how many of us even bother to wish "Happy Birthday!" to all our many Facebook friends?

### Social Media as a Tool

*Several of my best friends don't live in the same city, state, country, or even continent as myself or each other.*

To me, social media isn't a toy, but instead it is a tool. It is a tool that has kept many of my friendships alive, both personal and professional. Many of which may not otherwise have remained alive due not only to my various moves over the past few years, but also due to geographic isolation - a barrier that has separated people for the entirety of human history.

Social Media also serves (or can serve) to breakdown many of the other barriers that separate us - religion, nationality, culture etc...
// Lookup various other things that keep us apart //

Probably all of you know that I travel at pretty much any opportunity I have and the result of this has given me the opportunity to expand my world-view though people and lots of friends with different backgrounds than my own.

I've also made them part of my network of friends. I have, as much as they have, a vested interest in their families, in their cultures, in their languages, in their person.

Social media hasn't just allowed me to make friends across the globe, it's allowed me to keep friends across the globe.

### "Real" Friends are Still Important

Of course, having people present is important.








Safe travels and happy surfing!

### Afterthoughts
Although I've found it quite easy to find links online claiming that moving is "the third most stressful life event" according to "studies", I haven't found a single one of these that actually links to the study/studies.

And if you yourself are moving there are, of course, articles on [how to deal with the stress of moving] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-carol-morgan/11-tips-to-cope-with-the-stress-of-moving_b_8676914.html).
