I am a white, middle-class, Christian, heterosexual, American male. The only way I could get more boring is if I leaned Democratic and drove a Prius. Well, ok, I don't have a Prius.

My point is that I'm one of the most privileged people on the face of this green Earth. I literally have it all, and while there are some people who may deny the tailwinds they've enjoyed all their lives, I am not one.

### An Introduction

I feel that in the course of expressing all the privileges that I've enjoyed throughout my life, I've come to the conclusion that this post would make a better series than...an individual post.

My hope is to expound thoroughly on all of the points above - on all the things that contribute to my particular position of power at the top of the demographic pyramid.

I also want to emphasize, for anyone who may be part of any of the demographics of which I am also a part, that there is no need to feel ashamed or regretful. There is no use for shame or regret in being born who and how you are. The point of all and any of this (in the most general sense possible) is not to condemn or put down, in anyway. The point is to bring to light and make known the tailwinds that I myself, and each of the individual demographics that I'm part of, have enjoyed and continue to enjoy.

The point is to not take for granted. To extend a hand to those who have yet to achieve. To build a better, brighter future for all our collective posterity.



Safe travels and happy surfing!
