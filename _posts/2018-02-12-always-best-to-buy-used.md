It’s always the best time to buy used.


With tax reform in full swing and everyone getting a little bit fatter paycheck, it's still the best time to buy used.

The last vehicle I owned was a 1996 Ford Ranger. Yes, it had a four cylinder engine and, of course, it was manual. What a glorious little truck and it was all mine for a paltry $1,200.

Sure, it was 20 years old when I bought it. And sure, it had 140k+ miles on it when I bought it. But the lima engine in it is one of the most reliable and longest-production engines Ford has ever built (insert Ford jokes here). In fact, I’ve never owned a car with less than 100k miles on it.



### Used Cars at An All Time High
Off-lease vehicles

### Vehicle Maintenance on Older Cars is Cheaper



### Major Maintenance on Older Cars is Way Cheaper

Safe travels and happy surfing!
