I've had many people ask over the years why I'm interested in traveling. I recently had another American ask me on the train outside Hanoi, the capital of Communist Vietnam, and I figured I'd answer that for you all as well.

### Communist Yesterday, Russia Today
The first time I went out of the States[^1] was when I went to Russia (aka [Mother Russia][1]) during the summer between my sophomore and junior years at Rice. I was interning with United Space Alliance at the time and working onsite at Johnson Space Center when I found out about a new program through Rice's Baker Institute - the [Moscow Summer Intern Program][2].

It was a frenzied two weeks to rush my first passport to my door, but who can pass up a free trip to Russia? As I sat on the 11-hour direct Singapore Airlines flight, the only things I felt I knew about Russia were the plethora of American stereotypes and stories my mom had shared from her trip to the USSR in the late-70's.

These stereotypes include, of course,

Safe travels and happy surfing!
